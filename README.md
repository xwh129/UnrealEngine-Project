# UnrealEngine-Project
The project given is my college graduation design task.
It's a very simple maze game program that can automatically generate a random maze scene, and the goal of this game is to reach the terminal point with enemies' disturb and player's special abilities such like Time Pausing, Guide Path, Charge, and so on.
